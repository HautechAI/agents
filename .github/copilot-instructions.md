# Copilot Instructions

Before suggesting code or documentation changes, read all files under the `docs/` directory first.

Guidelines:
- Scan and internalize: `docs/**` (including contributing and style guides) before generating proposals.
- Prefer the documented standards and conventions over inferred patterns.
- If conflicts arise between existing code and documentation, flag the conflict and suggest aligning to docs.
- Favor minimal, reversible changes and keep scope limited to this repository.
